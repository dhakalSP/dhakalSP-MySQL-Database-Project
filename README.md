Overview
This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts focused on various database operations, particularly in the context of Human Resource (HR) data analysis. The project demonstrates the use of MySQL to create and manage tables, write complex queries, and perform transactional operations. Additionally, it covers the management of real estate data and reporting using advanced SQL techniques.

Project Structure
1. Table Creation and Data Population
Create Tables: Scripts to define and create necessary database tables for HR, real estate, and other related datasets.
Populate Data: Insert statements are included to populate the tables with initial datasets, ensuring that the database is ready for analysis and reporting.
2. SQL Queries
Select Functions: Queries designed to retrieve and display data from the database based on specific conditions, such as employee details sorted by starting salary or department-wise summaries.
Count Functions: Aggregation queries that provide counts of records, such as the number of employees in each department.
3. HR Data Analysis
This section includes SQL scripts aimed at analyzing HR data, such as:

Sorting employees by their starting salary and filtering based on the year they started.
Summarizing salaries within each department.
Joining tables to display combined information, such as department names alongside employee names.
4. View Creation and Transactional Operations
View Creation: Scripts to create views that encapsulate complex queries for easier access and reusability. For example, a view that combines department and employee data with calculated fields.
Transactions: SQL scripts that simulate real-world transactional operations, such as adding new departments and employees, updating salary information, and reflecting changes due to employee departures.
5. Real Estate Data Management
This section includes scripts for managing real estate data:

Table Modifications: Alteration of existing tables to meet new requirements, such as changing data types or renaming columns.
Data Import/Export: Scripts for importing data from external files and exporting results for reporting purposes.
Randomization and Reporting: Techniques to randomize data for testing and reporting, including creating views that summarize sales data by year, product family, and management hierarchies.
6. Advanced Queries and Reporting
Complex Queries: Advanced SQL scripts for performing in-depth analysis, such as calculating commissions, summarizing sales, and handling complex joins.
Views for Reporting: Creating views that combine multiple tables and calculations to generate comprehensive reports, which can be used for business decision-making.
Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive guide for using MySQL in managing and analyzing data, particularly in HR and real estate contexts. The SQL scripts included provide a robust foundation for performing complex data operations, creating views, and handling real-world transactional scenarios.
